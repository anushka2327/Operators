# Operators
## Program 1
## Aim:
Cpp program to show the usage of operators.
## Theory:
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of integer types. These operators allow direct manipulation of bits within an integer, making them useful for tasks requiring low-level data processing. In this program, we demonstrate the use of several bitwise operators in C++ by performing operations on two integers.  
Bitwise Operators:  
  
The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its operands. If both bits are 1, the resulting bit is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.  
OR operator compares each bit of its operands. If at least one of the bits is 1, the resulting bit is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.   
The bitwise NOT operator inverts all the bits of its operand, turning 1s into 0s and 0s into 1s. It is a unary operator.    
The bitwise XOR operator compares each bit of its operands. If the bits are different, the resulting bit is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.
The left shift operator shifts the bits of its first operand to the left by the number of positions specified by its second operand. Bits shifted out on the left are discarded, and zero bits are shifted in on the right.The right shift operator shifts the bits of its first operand to the right by the number of positions specified by its second operand. Bits shifted out on the right are discarded

## Program 2
## Aim:
To check which coordinate lies in which quadrant 
## Theory  
In the Cartesian coordinate system, a point is defined by its coordinates (x, y). The plane is divided into four quadrants, determined by the signs of the x and y coordinates. The quadrants are defined as follows:

Quadrant I: Both x and y are positive. (x > 0, y > 0)
Quadrant II: x is negative and y is positive. (x < 0, y > 0)
Quadrant III: Both x and y are negative. (x < 0, y < 0)
Quadrant IV: x is positive and y is negative. (x > 0, y < 0)
the program uses the operators to get the desired result

## Program 3:
## Aim:
program to calculate teh grade of student
## Theory:
This C++ program calculates the grade of a student based on the marks obtained in five subjects: Mathematics, English, Mara (possibly a local language or subject), Science, and Social Studies (SST). The program takes input marks for each subject, calculates the average percentage, and then determines the grade based on the average.
The program uses conditional statements (if, else if, else) to determine the grade based on the average percentage.
